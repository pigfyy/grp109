          Hello! My name's Ashton. I use he/they pronouns, I'm 21, and
          originally from Idaho. That's me in the photos, and they're just
          about the only ones of myself I'm happy with. I think it's much
          easier to relate to someone when you have some common ground, so let
          me lay out some of my interests for you:

        <p>
          I love anything and everything related to computers! I've first
          started programming in 5th grade, and never stopped. I've made
          everything from Unity and Unreal games to Python bots, Blender
          addons, simple AI, and mobile apps. I've also ran servers for
          multiple projects, both self-hosted and remote. Tech's acted as my
          consistent interest thoughout life, and a career in the field is my
          main ambition.

        <p>
          I don't make music (yet), but I <i>am</i> passionate about it! I
          primarily listen to hyperpop and some rap at the moment, with some
          more acoustic stuff thrown in there on occasion. To start naming
          some artists, my favorites are William Crooks, 100 gecs,
          underscores, JPEGMAFIA, and midwxst. I've included my current two
          favorite albums here. Left to right, they're <i>Wallsocket</i> by
          underscores and <i>Roll With The Punches</i> by Perry Maysun.
          They're links! Click them and skip around a bit. They're very
          different albums.

          I'm also a hobby photographer! I prefer to shoot on film, but
          occasionally do digital as well. I've included some of my personal
          favorites here. You can click these, too! They'll open in a new tab.
