          Hello! My name's Ashton. I use he/they pronouns, I'm 21, and
          originally from Idaho. That's me in the photos, and they're just
          about the only ones of myself I'm happy with. I think it's much
          easier to relate to someone when you have some common ground, so let

          I love anything and everything related to computers! I've first
          started programming in 5th grade, and never stopped. I've made
          everything from Unity and Unreal games to Python bots, Blender
          addons, simple AI, and mobile apps. I've also ran servers for
          multiple projects, both self-hosted and remote. Tech's acted as my
          consistent interest thoughout life, and a career in the field is my
          main ambition.

          I don't make music (yet), but I <i>am</i> passionate about it! I
          primarily listen to hyperpop and some rap at the moment, with some
          more acoustic stuff thrown in there on occasion. To start naming
          some artists, my favorites are William Crooks, 100 gecs,
          underscores, JPEGMAFIA, and midwxst. I've included my current two
          favorite albums here. Left to right, they're <i>Wallsocket</i> by
          underscores and <i>Roll With The Punches</i> by Perry Maysun.
          They're links! Click them and skip around a bit. They're very
          different albums.

         <p>Hi, I'm Divya! I’m originally from Sri Lanka and have deep roots in India, where I spent most of my life and completed my degree in 
            Agricultural 
            Sciences. After moving to the United States two years ago, I decided to take on a new challenge—transitioning into the tech field.

         <img src="../images/members/divya/childcare_pic.jpg" alt="picture of a child and Teacher doing writing activity together"></a>
         <p>Before starting this journey, I worked as a Childcare Assistant Teacher. While shifting careers hasn’t been without its challenges, it’s 
            been an exciting and rewarding experience. I’m passionate about learning, and I’m eager to grow in this new space.

         <p>Outside of studies, I enjoy creative activities like embroidery, sewing, and clay modeling. I also love caring for indoor and ornamental 
            plants— 
            anthuriums are a particular favorite of mine, and I tend to a small collection in my home. This transition into tech is a big step, but it combines my 
            curiosity, creativity, and care for growth—all of which I bring into everything I do.
