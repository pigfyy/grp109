    <h1>Welcome to Artisanal Slice</h1>
    <h3>What is this project?</h3>
    <p>
        Artisanal Slice is a collaborative web development project, 
        crafted to flex our web development muscles using HTML, CSS, 
        and JavaScript. Our goal? To simulate a small business website 
        for a local pizza joint. Spoiler alert: we may have gotten a 
        bit carried away with the toppings!
    </p>

  <div id="about-inspiration">
    <h3>What inspired the site?</h3>
    <p>
        The concept was inspired by the increasing demand for customizable food ordering experiences. 
        We noticed that independent restaurants often need a clean and user-friendly website to effectively 
        compete with larger brands. Pizza was an ideal choice because it’s universally loved, easily customizable, 
        and perfect for showcasing interactivity, such as adding toppings and updating the cart in real time. 
        And let’s be honest... who doesn’t love pizza? It’s like the universe’s way of saying, “You deserve a cheesy slice of joy!”

  <div id="about-purpose">
    <h3>What’s the purpose of the site?</h3>

        We wanted to create a space where users could play around, explore our imaginary menu, 
        and, most importantly, build their ultimate pizza without any guilt. 
        We aimed to create an enjoyable experience that reflects real-world online ordering 
        while applying the skills we learned during our project.
