            <p>
                We wanted to create a pizza restaurant website is an interactive restaurant menu website where
                users can browse dishes, customize their meals, and can explore special
                offers. It features a responsive design, user-friendly navigation, and a

                To provide users with an engaging and convenient way to interact with a
                restaurant's menu online. This site focuses on enhancing user experience

                <li>Customizable meal</li>

                <li>Responsive design
                    <p>
                        A responsive design would ensure that our website works smoothly 
                        on all screens (phone, tablet, desktop). Everything we learnt this quarter was 
                        focused on creating sites for laptops. Throughout the project we focused on
                        optimizing a laptop user's experience, and could expand on our project later
                        by ensuring it works on all other screens.
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li>Accessible design
                    <p>
                        While we did learn about making designs accessible, our team chose not to 
                        prioritize this goal (aside from text readability). With the time given, 
                        we felt it was best to focus our energy on making the design as intercative 
                        and easy to navigate as possible.In the future, we could continue the project 
                        and test the site for accessibility.
